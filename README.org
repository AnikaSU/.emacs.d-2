* Preface

This is a configuration for Emacs on Debian Testing (currently
Stretch). While most of it should work pretty much on any platform,
installing Emacs (Emacs 25.1 at the time of writing) is Debian
specific:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo apt install emacs25
#+END_SRC

In addition, to addition need to be made for PDF Tools and
LaTeX. First a library for PDF Tools:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo apt install libpoppler-glib-dev
#+END_SRC

Second, we define a central bibliographic folder at the level of the
LaTeX distribution. We first check the actual BibTeX folder:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  kpsewhich -show-path=.bib
#+END_SRC

This should contain:
=/home/<user>/.texlive2016/texmf-var/bibtex/bib//=. We thus link the
bibliographic folder (here =~/Work/Biblio/=) to this folder:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mkdir -p ~/.texlive2016/texmf-var/bibtex/bib
  ln -s ~/Work/Biblio/ ~/.texlive2016/texmf-var/bibtex/bib
#+END_SRC

Finally, we also add a Python library for SQL formating, and Ditaa
for ASCII-based diagrams:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo pip install format-sql
  sudo apt install ditaa  
#+END_SRC


* Getting started

To configure Emacs, the easiest is simply to clone this repository in
the =home= directory :

#+BEGIN_SRC sh  
  git clone https://github.com/basille/.emacs.d ~
  #+END_SRC

And that's it! Opening Emacs will then do the magic!


** A note on the use of =org-mode= for literate configuration

The [[https://github.com/larstvei/dot-emacs][original idea]] is to embed configuration bits into an Org file
([[/init.org][init.org]]), which contains both code and explanations, making it a lot
easier to navigate and configure. Emacs, with the use of =org-babel=
is able to extract all configuration bits and assemble them in a
standard =init.el= file, and its compiled version =init.elc=. The
trick to make it work is that there is already an initial =init.el=
file provided with this repository, which does the job the first time
Emacs is loaded.

The initial =init.el= file also adjusts =Xresources= for Emacs (start
maximized and without scrollbars), and create the folder structure
necessary for the rest of the configuration.

This file looks like that:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; This file replaces itself with the actual configuration at first run.

  ;; Add X options to ~/.Xresources and initialize them
  (write-region "
  ! Emacs geometry
  !
  emacs.fullscreen: maximized
  emacs.geometry: 250x250
  emacs.toolBar: off
  emacs.verticalScrollBars: off
  emacs.horizontalScrollbars: off
  emacs25.fullscreen: maximized
  emacs25.geometry: 250x250
  emacs25.toolBar: off
  emacs25.verticalScrollBars: off
  emacs25.horizontalScrollbars: off

  " nil "~/.Xresources" 'append)
  (shell-command "xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources")

  ;; Create necessary directories and save abbrev silently
  (mkdir (concat user-emacs-directory "cache"))
  (mkdir (concat user-emacs-directory "save"))
  (setq abbrev-file-name "~/.emacs.d/cache/abbrev_defs")
  (setq save-abbrevs 'silently)
  
  ;; We can't tangle without org!
  (require 'org)
  ;; Open the configuration
  (find-file (concat user-emacs-directory "init.org"))
  ;; tangle it
  (org-babel-tangle)
  ;; load it
  (load-file (concat user-emacs-directory "init.el"))
  ;; finally byte-compile it
  (byte-compile-file (concat user-emacs-directory "init.el"))
#+END_SRC

Note that this file is "locked" by Git, so that it is not modified
after the complete =init.el= file is prepared, with the command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git update-index --assume-unchanged init.el
#+END_SRC

To "unlock" it and make changes to the initial =init.el= file, use:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git update-index --no-assume-unchanged init.el
#+END_SRC

After this initial load, a function (=tangle-init=) ensures that a new
=init.el= is generated at every modification of =init.org= (precisely
every time =init.org= is saved).

* Screenshots

A good demonstration could not be complete without screenshots, so
here is Emacs in action:

- Emacs on the =init.org= config file, in Org mode, with
  Project-explorer in the left window, and Magit in the right window
  with its main commands at the bottom.

  #+CAPTION: Emacs in Org mode + project explorer + Magit
  #+NAME: emacs-org
  [[emacs-proj-org-magit.png]]

- Emacs opened with a RMarkdown file (=.Rmd=), including YAML headers
  and R code chunks, with the help page of a function in the right
  window together with the R buffer at the bottom.

* To-do

- Flycheck
- R:
  - indentation to follow R parser
  - Set up Polymode for R (weave/tangle/export, previous/next chunk)
  - hs-org/minor-mode not working
  - Document ESS
- Integrate Markdown-toc (bug)
- SQL server credentials
- Configure Org mode
- Additional functions
